Thus, with automation, for example, the new patterns of human association tend to eliminate jobs. It is true that this is the negative result. Positively, automation creates roles for people, which is to say, depth of involvement in their work and human association that our preceding mechanical technology had destroyed. Many people would be disposed to say that it was not the machine, but what one did with the machine, that was its meaning or message. In terms of the ways in which the machine altered our relations to one another and to ourselves, it mattered not in the least whether it turned out cornflakes or Cadillacs.

P. Snow, reviewing a book of A. L. Rowse (The New York Times Book Review, December 24, 1961) on Appeasement and the road to Munich, describes the top level of British brains and experience in the 1930s. \"Their I.Q.'s were much higher than usual among political bosses. Why were they such a disaster?\" The view of Rowse, Snow approves: \"They would not listen to warnings because they did not wish to hear.\" Being anti-Red made it impossible for them to read the message of Hitler. But their failure was as nothing compared to our present one. The American stake in literacy as a technology or uniformity applied to every level of education, government, industry, and social life is totally threatened by the electric technology. The threat of Stalin or Hitler was external. The electric technology is within the gates, and we are numb, deaf, blind, and mute about its encounter with the Gutenberg technology, on and through which the American way of life was formed. It is, however, no time to suggest strategies when the threat has not even been acknowledged to exist. I am in the position of Louis Pasteur telling doctors that their greatest enemy was quite invisible, and quite unrecognized by them. Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the \"content\" of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind. The effect of the medium is made strong and intense just because it is given another medium as \"content.\" The content of a movie is a novel or a play or an opera. The effect of the movie form is not related to its program content. The \"content\" of writing or print is speech, but the reader is almost entirely unaware either of print or of speech.","parent":"posts/page8.txt","score":0.8655446242901461},{"content":"It is this aspect of new art that Kenneth Galbraith recommends to the careful study of businessmen who want to stay in business.
