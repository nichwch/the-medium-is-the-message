Gombrich (Art and Illusion) as \"the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity and to enforce one reading of the picture—that of a man-made construction, a colored canvas.\" For cubism substitutes all facets of an object simultaneously for the \"point of view\" or facet of perspective illusion. Instead of the specialized illusion of the third.","parent":"posts/page4.txt","score":0.8108443484273714},{"content":"Emile Durkheim long ago expressed the idea that the specialized task always escaped the action of the social conscience.

Perfect adaptation to any environment is achieved by a total channeling of energies and vital force that amounts to a kind of static terminus for a creature. Even slight changes in the environment of the very well adjusted find them without any resource to meet new challenge. Such is the plight of the representatives of \"conventional wisdom\" in any society. Their entire stake of security and status is in a single form of acquired knowledge, so that innovation is for them not novelty but annihilation.","parent":"posts/page16.txt","score":0.8044056005774656},{"content":"As Selye deals with the total environmental situation in his “stress” theory of disease, so the latest approach to media study considers not only the “content” but the medium and the cultural matrix within which the particular medium operates.","parent":"posts/page3.txt","score":0.8042320089661018},{"content":"A related form of challenge that has always faced cultures is the simple fact of a frontier or a wall, on the other side of which exists another kind of society. Mere existence side by side of any two forms of organization generates a great deal of tension. Such, indeed, has been the principle of symbolist artistic structures in the past century. Toynbee observes that the challenge of a civilization set side by side with a tribal society has over and over demonstrated that the simpler society finds its integral economy and institutions \"disintegrated by a rain of psychic energy generated by the civilization\" of the more complex culture. When two societies exist side by side, the psychic challenge of the more complex one acts as an explosive release of energy in the simpler one. For prolific evidence of this kind of problem it is not necessary to look beyond the life of the teenager lived daily in the midst of a complex urban center. As the barbarian was driven to furious restlessness by the civilized contact, collapsing into mass migration, so the teenager, compelled to share the life of a city that cannot accept him as an adult, collapses into \"rebellion without a cause.\" Earlier the adolescent had been provided with a raincheck. He was prepared to wait it out. But since TV, the drive to participation has ended adolescence, and every American home has its Berlin wall.","parent":"posts/page16.txt","score":0.803602280692754}]}
